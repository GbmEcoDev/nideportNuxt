On February 21st, members of the NIDEPORT Community Relations Department held a meeting with the current authorities of the "Sports, Cultural and Recreational Commission" of Cruce Caballero.

The meeting was held in the Community Room where the Commission frequently carries out several activities targeting young people from the local and surrounding community.

The Commission's authorities described in detail the functioning and composition of the Commission and highlighted the main goal that made this community space emerge: supporting young people and generating greater local identity in the community.

The local women's soccer league is one of the main initiatives that has been developed lately. This league succeeded in arriving at a final match open to the community with an awards ceremony.

Additionally, the Commission is currently promoting volleyball and different disciplines workshops.

In line with NIDEPORT's corporate culture, the company's interest in this type of actions was expressed and the idea of jointly generating various activities aimed at young people from an environmental perspective was reinforced.
