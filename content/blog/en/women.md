The Nueva Esperanza Cooperative has started using the inputs provided by NIDEPORT under the Mujeres Cultivadoras project. The Nueva Esperanza Cooperative is an agroecological and sustainable project for the production of different products that a group of women from Paraje Gentile, San Pedro, Misiones, is carrying out. These entrepreneurs produce vinegars, liqueurs, and dressings from native wild fruits of the Parana rainforest grown by themselves or collected from the jungle, such as caraguatá, jaracatiá, jaboticaba, pitanga, guabiroba, among others.

Recently, NIDEPORT's Community Relations Area launched the Mujeres Cultivadoras project in conjunction with the cooperative to establish relationships that strengthen the cooperative in terms of productivity, trade, and social capital.

Through a dialogue with representatives of the cooperative, it was possible to generate a transfer of inputs and machinery that the cooperative needed to improve production. The cooperative has already installed and started using the inputs.
