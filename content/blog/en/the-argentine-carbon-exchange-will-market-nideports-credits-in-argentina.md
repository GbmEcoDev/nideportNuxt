Nideport selected the Argentine Carbon Exchange (BACX) to market 50,000 credits (verified carbon units, VCU’s) from the future issuance of the Selva Paranaense Vida Nativa project under the Verra standard, an ambitious project covering 24,643 hectares in the province of Misiones, aimed at the restoration of degraded forests.

The president of BACX, Alejandro Guerrero, highlighted the quality of the carbon credits to be issued and considered that the agreement signed for one of the projects with the greatest potential in the country, "emphasizes the importance of Argentine companies offsetting with assets produced within the same national territory."

"At BACX, we are pleased with the trust that Nideport has placed in our team by entrusting us with the custody and commercialization of their project for the Argentine market," said Guerrero, adding that "these signals position us as the first carbon exchange in the world in terms of risk coverage for the companies that work with us. Insurance, reliable ratings, and proven technology translate into high-quality transactions."

The first digital carbon exchange in the Americas structured one of the most reliable B2B marketplace models in the world in terms of compliance and reduced risk for companies' offsetting needs.

## The Nideport Project

With a 100-year plan, Nideport is a company that develops carbon credit projects dedicated to ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation with a social approach, empowering local communities through their integration into the conservation process.

The more than 24,000 hectares of the Selva Paranaense Vida Nativa Project had previously been exploited for over 100 years, which left the land severely degraded. The first step was to stop deforestation and then proceed with restoration. This process includes the use of advanced technologies such as blockchain traceability to ensure transparency in fund management and results, as well as the implementation of satellite monitoring to control environmental impact. The restoration generates 35 credits per hectare, making it the project with the highest CO₂ absorption ratio. This positions it as one of the most efficient in terms of CO₂ absorption, contributing effectively to climate change mitigation and the sustainable economic development of the region.

"We trust BACX as the platform that provides the highest security to Argentine companies for our transactions while also helping to prevent forest degradation," said Tomás Gutiérrez, the company's Chief Financial Officer.

Gutiérrez explained that "the more is invested in biodiversity preservation and local communities, the more valuable the credits produced become. Biodiversity and the planet benefit through companies because they can focus on their core activities knowing they have a partner helping them reduce their carbon footprint".
