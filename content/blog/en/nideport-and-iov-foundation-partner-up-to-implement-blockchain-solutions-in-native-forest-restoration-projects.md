Nideport, a company committed to the restoration of ecosystems and the regeneration of native forests, announced a strategic alliance with Fundación IOV, which is dedicated to addressing the crisis of trust by providing solutions in the field of Blockchain technology. As a result of this agreement, two pilot projects have already been carried out. 

The objective of this collaboration is to continue scaling to more communities and more initiatives that use blockchain traceability in order to optimize transparency and monitoring of funding for local communities, where Nideport develops its forest restoration projects.

The use of AGUA, an open source tool developed by Globant, provided Nideport, as well as the communities and external entities, the ability to verify the actions carried out, the delivery of materials, the construction of housing improvements and the development of training processes within these communities. 


Together with other proposals with social impact that Nideport carries out with the local population, the company works with the native community of Tekoa Alecrin, which groups approximately 50 families of the Mbyá-Guarani people in the department of San Pedro in the province of Misiones. 

Based on a process of Free, Prior and Informed Consultation (FPIC), different needs of the community were identified, where, among the most urgent, a deficit in housing infrastructure was identified. 

Therefore, in agreement with the authorities of the community and the Mburuvicha (Guaraní chief) Sebastián Benítez, it was decided to develop the Oga Project (which means “house” in Guaraní language) from which wooden houses have been built to respect their traditional housing methods (6 of the 35 planned have already been completed). 

The houses were designed through a participatory process involving the community, Nideport and the construction company contracted for the project. Within this framework, workshops for self-construction with wood were also held with different members of the community, who are the direct beneficiaries of the houses.


In addition, support was provided to the Nueva Esperanza Cooperative through the “Mujeres Cultivadoras” project, in which 14 members of the Misiones locality of Paraje Gentile manufacture handmade vinegar based on fruits of the native forest (jaboticaba, palm heart, yerba mate and pindo, among others). 

The support consists of training in administration, marketing and production management, as well as the donation of new equipment to improve and expand the cooperative’s production capacity. 

This is done through a collaboration and understanding agreement between Nideport and the authorities of the cooperative, represented by its president Nélida Richardt.

Meanwhile, Nideport’s use of the AGUA tool reinforces transparency and external verification in project management, while ensuring that Nideport’s efforts in social impact initiatives, such as the Oga Project and support for the Nueva Esperanza Cooperative, are aligned with sustainability standards and recognized by all stakeholders. 

The partnership between Nideport and Fundación IOV also allows for the possibility of transferring technologies, providing technical assistance, conducting studies and carrying out research to promote the use of decentralized and technological solutions to improve traceability and transparency in projects with social and environmental impact.

“Our collaboration with Fundación IOV will allow us to apply innovative technologies such as blockchain to ensure greater transparency and security in our processes. We are convinced that this technology will help us boost our impact on local communities and biodiversity restoration,” said Juan Nuñez, CEO of Nideport. 

The Director of Fundación IOV, Sabrina Díaz Rato, said: “This implementation represents a transcendental step forward for us, standing out as an exemplary case of transparency in the management of social impact projects. This first step has allowed us to understand the immense value that these technologies bring by tracing and recording, in a manner auditable by third parties, the resources allocated to the communities”.

Marcio Degiovannini, VP Delivery of the Blockchain & Fast Code Studio at Globant, added: “At Globant, we developed AGUA with the purpose of boosting transparency in the management of funds and strengthening trust in sustainable projects. We are proud that, through blockchain technology, this product is generating a positive impact on local communities and contributing to the preservation of the environment”.

The partnership thus marks an important milestone in the use of advanced technologies to improve transparency and efficiency in triple-impact ecological restoration projects. Transparency not only builds trust, but also enhances the positive impact that can be generated in communities and the environment.
