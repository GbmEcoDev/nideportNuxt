**We understand ecological restoration as a holistic process.**  
Restoring an ecosystem is not just about planting trees: it is about regenerating relationships, strengthening local economies, and creating sustainable opportunities for the communities that inhabit the territories where we work.

Along this path, we take a key step forward by announcing a **commercial partnership with *Belleza India***, a conscious wellness brand with which we share principles, values, and a common vision of the relationship between nature, ancestral knowledge, and human development.

### **A Strategic Partnership with Purpose**

This partnership enables products developed within the **“Women Growers”** project—carried out together with the **Nueva Esperanza Cooperative** in the province of Misiones—to reach final consumers through a channel that is aligned with their origin and their story.

Belleza India is more than a point of sale. It is a strategic partner that values territorial work, highlights ancestral knowledge, and brings natural products to a broad and conscious community. Through this alliance, **artisanal vinegars made from native fruits of the Misiones rainforest**, such as jaboticaba, yerba mate, and palm heart, find a space where their environmental, social, and cultural value is understood and respected.

**Producing with Identity**

### **Real Impact on the Women Growers Cooperative**

For the **Nueva Esperanza Cooperative**, this partnership represents far more than a new commercialization channel. It means:

- greater economic stability,  
- expanded market access,  
- strengthened collective work,  
- and new opportunities for long-term growth.

Each product that reaches someone’s table is the result of a process that begins in the forest: in the restoration of degraded soils, the protection of biodiversity, and the support of women who have found in local production a sustainable path for development.

This commercial agreement helps consolidate that process, ensure its continuity, and project it into the future—laying the groundwork for additional forest-based products to be incorporated in the near future.

### **A Regenerative Model**

At Nideport, we work by integrating **Biodiversity, Climate, and Community**. We believe partnerships are essential to scaling impact without losing coherence. That is why we celebrate this collaboration with Belleza India: it demonstrates that it is possible to build a consumption model that regenerates nature while strengthening human connections.

This is only the first stage of a journey we aim to continue building as a network—guided by sensitivity, commitment, and shared purpose.
