A multidisciplinary team have travelled to the province of Misiones in northern Argentina with the main goal of gathering information on habitat structures important for biodiversity conservation.

These missions in Vida Nativa GS1 Reserve are expected to supply critical information in support of the mapping of structural essential biodiversity of the area.

GS1 Reserve is the area designated for our first stage in jungle protection. The in-territory tasks will do a precise, accurate and complete land inventory indispensable for the establishment of the GS1 Reserve and its development.

Is time to act. It's time to get involved.

Help Nideport Initiative to grow by purchasing 1m2 of land under ecological restoration.
