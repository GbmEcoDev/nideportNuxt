We are excited to share great news! **Nideport has achieved certification for its first project in the Misiones Jungle**, marking a historic step in our mission of ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation.

Located on an expanse of 22,878 hectares in the Misiones Jungle, this project is a testament to our commitment to sustainability and the restoration of natural capital.

**The Verra certification validates the authenticity and quality of our carbon credits**, demonstrating our adherence to the most rigorous standards of sustainability and transparency.

**Our carbon credits, backed by VCS, CCB, and the IFM methodology**, represent a real and permanent mitigation of emissions, offering a unique opportunity for companies committed to sustainability.

From caring for endangered species to the active participation of local communities, our project seeks a comprehensive positive impact on biodiversity and social responsibility.

Companies committed to sustainability can purchase carbon credits from the Misiones Jungle and actively contribute to ecological restoration and climate change mitigation.

**Looking to the future, Nideport aims to restore 45 million hectares by 2035.**
